## Description
### Purpose
The project's primary objective was to create a static website hosted on AWS, offering a seamless user experience. It allows users to input their name and receive a personalised message by clicking the submit button. The custom message is generated using both the user-provided name and their IP address which is retrieved in real-time via a REST API.
